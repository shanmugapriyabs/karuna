						<h1>PRIDE <span>OF INDIA</span></h1>
						<h4>Little Story</h4>
						<p>Revolt of 1857:
Also called India’s first war of independence, it
began at Meerut on May 10, 1857, and slowly
spread across Delhi, Agra, Kanpur and Lucknow.
It was the first significant uprising against the
East India Company. Although the Revolt was
unsuccessful, it had a significant impact on the
masses and inspired India’s entire Independence
Movement.
It was the revolt of 1857 which gave a clear
message to the British Crown that the East India
Company had failed to exercise control over the
country, demonstrating its incapacity.
The British East India Company’s control came to
an end with this fight for independence.
After the British Crown seized control of India
from the East India Company in 1858, it became
a British colony in law. Following this, India was
directly governed by the British government
through governors general.</p>

						<p>Swadeshi Movement – 1905-1911:
The Swadeshi Movement was a consequence of
Lord Curzon’s announcement for the partition of
Bengal in 1905, on the grounds that the
population of Bengal as a whole would be
difficult to govern over.
However, the British declared the division of
Bengal into two provinces with the intention of
undermining nationalist unity.
The “Boycott” resolution was adopted at a
conference held at the Calcutta Town Hall on
August 7, 1905, thus establishing the Swadeshi
movement and bringing its previously
fragmented leadership under one leadership.
The goal of the Swadeshi movement was to
encourage the usage of local goods and services
while denouncing their British counterparts.
This raised India’s economic standing and
demonstrated to the British that Indians could
live independently.
When British products were openly torched, this
movement became violent. The British started
detaining the agitators to address this issue, and
ultimately Bengal was partitioned.
The Swadeshi Movement was a turning point in
Indian history because it demonstrated the
nation’s unity and helped people see that they
could defeat the British if they united. </p>
						<p>Champaran Satyagrah – 1917:
Champaran Movement was Mahatma Gandhi’s
first act of civil disobedience during the struggle
for independence, which took place in the Bihar
region of Champaran in 1917.
Gandhi was persuaded by an indigo farmer,
Rajkumar Shukla, to visit Champaran to look
into the plight of the farmers, who were
subjected to oppressive regulations and high
taxes. Under the tinkathia system, they were
compelled to grow indigo by the British
colonists.
Gandhi gathered support from the local farmers
and masses to organise nonviolent protests
against planters and landlords, and as a result,
the government decided to do away with the
oppressive tinkathia system. Additionally, the
peasants were compensated with a part of the
money taken from them.
Gandhi organised three protests in Champaran,
Ahmedabad and Kheda during the years 1917
and 1918, before beginning the Rowlatt
Satyagraha.
Although the Champaran Satyagraha was the
first to be organised, the term ‘Satyagraha’ was
first used during the anti-Rowlatt Act protest,
which means, a non-violent method of protest </p>
<P>Rowlatt Satyagraha- 1919
The Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of
1919, passed by the British Indian government,
was more often known as the Rowlatt Act.
The Act granted the government the authority to
imprison anyone accused of engaging in terror
activities for up to two years without a trial. The
freedom of the press was likewise severely
restricted by the Rowlatt Act.
Mahatma Gandhi began a non-violent
Satyagraha on April 6, 1919, to protest against
the British government’s unfair Rowlatt Act,
which was called the Rowlatt Satyagraha.
A nationwide hartal was declared and people
were asked to hold meetings against the
repressive act and refrain from going to work.
While the hartal was successful in Delhi,
violence was witnessed in Punjab and a few
other places. Therefore, Gandhi suspended the
hartal in the wake of the violence.
The infamous Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which
took place in Amritsar on 13th April 1919, was
also the result of the protest against the Rowlatt
Act. This incident was a great reason for Indians
to struggle for India’s independence even
harder.</p>
<p> Khilafat and Non- Cooperation Movement – 1920
Khilafat Movement: The Indian Muslims were
not happy with the way the British dethroned
the Caliph in Turkey. So, in 1919, various protests
were held against the Britishers. The Muslim
League and Congress came together during this
time. Both of these parties worked together to
organise numerous political protests. The
movement was initially introduced on August 31,
1920, when the Khilafat Committee began a
campaign of non-cooperation.
The Indian National Congress (INC), led by
Mahatma Gandhi, began the Non-Cooperation
Movement on September 5, 1920. The Non-
Cooperation Movement is one of the key
movements in India’s independence struggle. It
was initiated by Gandhi in support of the
Khilafat Movement.
The aim was to boycott major social
programmes, events, offices and schools to
resonate with India’s struggle for independence.
In his declaration Gandhi, wanted people to
adopt Swadeshi principles and work for the
eradication of untouchability from society.
The open, non-violent protest against the
government by thousands of Indians was a true
mass movement.
The Indian National Congress called for selfgovernment
or Swarajya and only non-violent
methods were asked to be used while protesting
However, following the Chauri Chaura incident
in February 1922, where during a fight between
the police and protesters a violent crowd set fire
to a police station, killing 22 policemen, Gandhiji
decided to put an end to the movement.</p>
<p>Quit India Movement – 1942
The INC called for a widespread civil
disobedience movement when the Cripps
Mission, which arrived in India in March 1942,
was unable to promise any type of constitutional
remedy for India’s issues.
The idea of an independence movement in India
was accepted by the Congress Working
Committee at its Wardha meeting on July 14,
1942.
Gandhi began this movement in August 1942 in
an effort to compel the British to leave India.
This campaign, known as the “Bharat Chhodo
Andolan,” compelled the British colonial
authorities to consider leaving India.
The outcome of the movement was that Congress
was declared an unlawful association and its
offices all over the country were raided. The
leaders were arrested and there rose a chaotic
moment with this incident.
Despite heavy-handed suppression by the
government, the people were unfazed and
continued their struggle.
The movement placed the demand for complete
independence at the top agenda of the freedom
movement.</p>
<p>Individual Satyagraha – 1940
The leaders of the Indian National Congress
(INC) were unhappy with the British government
for dragging India into the Second World War in
1939, without the Indian people’s consent.
Indian backing for the war was highly desired by
the British government and as a result, the
Viceroy Linlithgow offered a series of
recommendations known as the “August offer.”
After the Indian nationalists demanded an
interim government in India in lieu of support in
World War II, Indians’ freedom to frame their
own constitution was acknowledged for the first
time in the August Offer, 1940.
However, the August Offer said after the war, a
representative Indian body would be established
to draft India’s Constitution, and it would be
given dominion status.
The INC rejected this offer at its meeting at
Wardha in August 1940 and demanded complete
freedom from the colonial rule. The Individual
Satyagraha was then started by Mahatma
Gandhi to uphold the right to free expression.
Brahma Datt, Vinoba Bhave and Jawaharlal
Nehru were the first three satyagrahis. The
satyagrahis also started a march towards Delhi,
which was called the ‘Delhi Chalo Movement’.
Although the movement failed to pick up steam
and was aborted in December 1940, it put the
Britishers under immense pressure.

Individual Satyagraha in the linked article.</p>
